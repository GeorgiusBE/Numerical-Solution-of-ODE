# Numerical-Solution-of-ODE
Numerical Solution of ODEs using Taylor Series Expansion and LU Decomposition
This project includes,
-	Performing Taylor series expansion (central difference) to numerically approximate each of the derivative terms in the ODE.
-	Transforming the numerically approximated ODE into a system of equations in matrix form (Ax = b) and employing Lower-Upper (LU) decomposition to solve the matrix equation.
-	Analyzing the effect of varying the number of partitions (n) on the accuracy of the numerical solution against the exact solution by comparing the MSE for different partition values.
